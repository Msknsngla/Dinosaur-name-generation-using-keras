# Dinosaur-name-generation-using-keras

This repository implements the concept of character level language modelling using keras. The algorithm learns patterns from the existing names and generates new names. The implementation uses a LSTM layer which is used to train the model. This project is a follow up for the weekly assignment of the sequence model course by coursera.
